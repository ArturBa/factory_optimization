	abstract = {A novel artificial immune system algorithm with social learning mechanisms (AIS-SL) is proposed in this paper. In AIS-SL, candidate antibodies are marked with an elitist swarm (ES) or a common swarm (CS). Correspondingly, these antibodies are named ES antibodies or CS antibodies. In the mutation operator, ES antibodies experience self-learning, while CS antibodies execute two different social learning mechanisms, that is, stochastic social learning (SSL) and heuristic social learning (HSL), to accelerate the convergence process. Moreover, a dynamic searching radius update strategy is designed to improve the solution accuracy. In the numerical simulations, five benchmark functions and a practical industrial application of proportional-integral-differential (PID) controller tuning is selected to evaluate the performance of the proposed AIS-SL. The simulation results indicate that AIS-SL has better solution accuracy and convergence speed than the canonical opt-aiNet, IA-AIS, and AAIS-2S.},

abstract = "Various algorithms inspired by evolutionary and physical processes have been extensively applied in solving complex construction engineering optimization problems. In this paper, Artificial Immune Systems (AIS), a computational approach inspired by the processes of human immune system, is introduced in terms of its basic mechanisms and its applications in construction engineering. Specifically, Clonal Selection Algorithm (CSA), one of main algorithms that form AIS, is based on clonal selection process of the immune system which includes the selection, hypermutation, and receptor editing processes. We discuss the CSA in detail and present its application in the classic construction optimization problem, construction site utilization planning (CSUP), which is the decision making process for identifying the most optimal layout of temporary facilities designed to support the construction process. When applied to a test case published in research literature, we found that CSA shows a robust capacity to search the solution space effectively and efficiently."
