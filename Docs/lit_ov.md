This article is about Clonal Selection Algorithm in engineering applications. It describes theoretical functioning of the algorithm and illustrates the workings of implemented algorithm on three different problems: a binary character recognition, multi-modal optimization of function – f(x, y) = x.sin(4πx)−y.sin(4πy+π)+1 and Traveling Salesman Problem for 30 cities.
