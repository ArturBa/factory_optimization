This article is about the artificial immune system in industrial application. Basing on cutting parameters (force, vibrations, torque etc.) they try to detect tool brake using a negative-selection algorithm.

This article is about the Clonal Selection Algorithm used for Optimalization in Electromagnetics. The authors present their own concept of real-coded clonal selection algorithm that can be used in electromagnetic design optimization. The article describes in detail all the algorithm parameters as well as the operation of the algorithm for "The TEAM Workshop problem 22”.[Campelo F. Guimaraes F. D. Ramires J.

This article is about the Clonal Selection Based Memetic Algorithm for Job Shop Scheduling Problems. The authors' goal was to improve exploration and exploitation using a clonal selection algorithm. The article presents the use of clonal selection to construct an evolutionary search mechanism that is used for exploration.[Yang J. Sun L. Lee HP. Qian Y.

This article is about Clonal Selection Algorithm in engineering applications. It describes theoretical functioning of the algorithm and illustrates the workings of implemented algorithm on three different problems: a binary character recognition, multi-modal optimization of function – f(x, y) = x.sin(4πx)−y.sin(4πy+π)+1 and Traveling Salesman Problem for 30 cities.

This article is about using Clonal Selection Algorithm to optimize the layout of a construction site. Presented algorithm is used to minimize production costs and traveling distance between n facilities which are represented in n x n permutation matrix. [Xi Wang, Abhijeet S. Deshpande, Gabriel B.
