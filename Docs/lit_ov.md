This article is about the artificial immune system in industrial application. Basing on cutting parameters (force, vibrations, torque etc.) they try to detect tool brake using a negative-selection algorithm.

This article is about the artificial immune system in industrial application. Authors compare AIS with Social Learning Mechanisms to few others AIS which use cloning alghoritm. Basing on proportionalâ€“/integralâ€“/derivative-time they try to tune a PID.

This article is about the Clonal Selection Algorithm used for Optimalization in Electromagnetics. The authors present their own concept of real-coded clonal selection algorithm that can be used in electromagnetic design optimization. The article describes in detail all the algorithm parameters as well as the operation of the algorithm for "The TEAM Workshop problem 22”.[Campelo F. Guimaraes F. D. Ramires J.

This article is about the Clonal Selection Based Memetic Algorithm for Job Shop Scheduling Problems. The authors' goal was to improve exploration and exploitation using a clonal selection algorithm. The article presents the use of clonal selection to construct an evolutionary search mechanism that is used for exploration.[Yang J. Sun L. Lee HP. Qian Y.
