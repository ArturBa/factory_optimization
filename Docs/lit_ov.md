This article is about the artificial immune system in industrial application. Basing on cutting parameters (force, vibrations, torque etc.) they try to detect tool brake using a negative-selection algorithm.

This article is about the artificial immune system in industrial application. Authors compare AIS with Social Learning Mechanisms to few others AIS which use cloning alghoritm. Basing on proportional–/integral–/derivative-time they try to tune a PID.
